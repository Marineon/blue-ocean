## Git Workflow
---
Do this once to set upstream. (not required but makes it easier)

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Marineon/blue-ocean.git

Update your master branch

    git checkout main
    git pull --rebase upstream main

Start work on a feature

    git checkout -b feature-branch

If you've already created a branch, just switch to it

    git checkout feature-branch

Write code, commit, repeat

    git add .
    git commit -m "clever message"

Rebase before pull request. First update main.

    get checkout main
    git pull --rebase upstream

Incorporate the changes from main into your feature branch.

    git checkout feature-branch
    git pull --rebase upstream main

Fix any merge conflicts then do:

    git add .
    git commit
    git rebase --continue

Push the feature branch.

    git push origin feature-branch

If you get warnings about it being rejected, try:

    git push origin feature-branch -f

Make a pull request on GitHub

After the pull request is merged,

    git checkout main
    git pull --rebase upstream main
    git branch -d feature-branch

git branch -d feature-branch just cleans up branches. You don't have to do this if you want to keep adding features to that branch (not recommended) and if git doesn't permit you to delete the branch because it think's it hasn't been merged yet, you can force it with `-D` instead of `-d`.
